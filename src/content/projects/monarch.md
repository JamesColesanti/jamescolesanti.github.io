Project Monarch was an initiative to create a search engine for an important partner of Code4Community, Lucy's Love Bus. This is an organization that helps children with cancer by providing free integrative therapies such as massage, yoga, meditation, and many more. Through the collaboration with C4C, we were able to create a platform for families to find these therapies much easier. The final product came with a simple user interface for searching, along with an admin portal so that Lucy's Love Bus could manage which therapies were offered.
