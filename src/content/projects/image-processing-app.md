Our program aims to create an image-processing application that can be used to apply different filters and effects to multiple layers of images. The program can hold one or more layers of images, and the user is able to switch between the layers to see the results of applying different effects. The current implemented effects include: sepia, monochrome, sharpen, blur, downscale, and mosaic. Example images can be found in the "res" folder.
