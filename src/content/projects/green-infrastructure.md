This project is a collaboration between Code4Community and the City of Boston. In an effort to promote awareness of climate change in Boston, city officials wanted a web application that residents could use to ensure "green areas", such as parks, garden, or trees, were properly being taken care of. The ultimate goal of the project is to allow individuals to adopt these areas and submit maintenance requests to the city if they become run-down. This is done through an interactive map displaying the sites around Boston, which is rendered with the help of the Google Maps API. A Beta version of the site is available below. There is still much work left to be done, so be sure to check back soon! The plan is for the project to be completed by the end of May.
