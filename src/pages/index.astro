       Hi! My name is James Colesanti, and I am a fourth-year computer science major with a concentration in software. I have had extensive experience developing coding projects in JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. During my most recent co-op at Integrity Security Services, I was responsible for the development of multiple full-stack features for the company’s public-key infrastructure management website. These features allowed me to hone my skills in React.js and Node.js.
       Additionally, I am a member of my school's Code4Community club, which is an organization that develops software solutions for nonprofits around the world. Through my work for my first project, Lucy's Love Bus, I had the opportunity to learn more about TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I am serving as a technical lead for the City of Boston's Green Infrastructure Web Application. This has allowed me to gain valuable experience designing web application architecture.
       My experiences thus far have helped me develop a strong passion for writing software, and I hope to continue to learn more about different languages and frameworks in the near future. I am currently looking for a full-time job in the field of software engineering/development.

  <HorizontalCard
    title="C/Place: Collaborative Pixel-Art Board"
    img="/CPlaceCover.png"
    desc="Our project idea, inspired by the collaborative project r/place on Reddit, is to implement a new type of interactable area that allows users to work together to incrementally contribute to a large digital canvas. The driving idea behind r/place is that “Individually, you can create something, but together, you can create something more,” and our own feature is driven by this core idea. We consider this a way to introduce a more permanent marker of progress in an application that focuses primarily on temporarily interactable areas. Using a grid system where a tile represents one “pixel”, a player can choose to change the color of one square at a time using a color picker. Players can paint over any pixel but are restricted to painting only one per allotted amount of time, to help keep contributions more balanced. This type of interaction introduces a more asynchronous activity that allows users to gradually contribute to a town over time, encouraging them to return to a town to continue their masterpiece and see what others have added to it. Additionally, users can interact through the comments section, and download the artwork as a jpg or mp4 to share with friends. After a certain amount of time has passed, the canvas is wiped to allow a new creation to be made, making space for new forms of expression. Past canvases are stored on an art wall for users to view and rewatch the creation process."
