       Hi! My name is James Colesanti, and I am a fourth-year computer science major with a concentration in software. I have had extensive experience developing coding projects in JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. During my most recent co-op at Integrity Security Services, I was responsible for the development of multiple full-stack features for the companyâ€™s public-key infrastructure management website. These features allowed me to hone my skills in React.js and Node.js.
       Additionally, I am a member of my school's Code4Community club, which is an organization that develops software solutions for nonprofits around the world. Through my work for my first project, Lucy's Love Bus, I had the opportunity to learn more about TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I am serving as a technical lead for the City of Boston's Green Infrastructure Web Application. This has allowed me to gain valuable experience designing web application architecture.
       My experiences thus far have helped me develop a strong passion for writing software, and I hope to continue to learn more about different languages and frameworks in the near future. I am currently looking for a full-time job in the field of software engineering/development.
